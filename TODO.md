## Possible development ideas:

- ~~Remove manual mask when uploading new image~~
- ~~Add feature to create mask directly on uploaded image~~
- ~~Add extensions validation function to handle input files~~
- ~~Make manual mask scale with window~~
- ~~Handle border error while adding manual mask~~
- Make app more unbreakable

## Code improvements:

- Cleanup ui code
- ~~Add docstrings~~
- Add more tests

## Possible user experience ideas:

- ~~Update README.md~~
- Add help bar to simplify flow
- Button add mask should work more like "Add image" then change to "Upload mask for selected photo" after validation that image is uploaded properly
